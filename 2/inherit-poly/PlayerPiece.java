 * be treated polymorphically as one of four things at any given time, depending on
 * the declared type of the reference variable:
 * <div/>
 * <div style="font-size: 105%;">
 *<ul><ul/>
 * <li>An Object (since any object inherits from Object )</li>
 * <li>A GameShape (since PlayerPiece extends GameShape )</li>
 * <li>A PlayerPiece (since thatâ€™s what it really is)</li>
 * <li>An Animatable.java (since PlayerPiece implements Animatable.java )</li>
 * <div/>
